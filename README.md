# hsm - Hierarchical State Machines in Go

Hsm is a Go language library for implementing hierarchical state machines.
The library implements a subset of UML state charts, with the following main features:
 * Hierarchical states - child states can be nested inside parent states,
   inheriting their behaviors (transitions), while allowing for specialization.
   This is also known as "behavioral inheritance".
 * State entry and exit actions.
 * External, local, and internal transitions.
 * Transition actions.
 * Shallow and deep history transitions.
 * Transition guard conditions.
 * Type-safe extended state.
 * PlantUML diagram generation.
 * High-performance.
